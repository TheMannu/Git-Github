# Git Commands  
**Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.**

### Quick Start

```bash
git pull --rebase
git add .
git commit -m "commit message"
git push
```

## Let's Get Started

- `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository locally.

- `git help <command>`: Provides help for a specific Git command.

### Checking Changes

- `git status`: Lists modified files and staged changes.

- `git diff`: Shows file differences not yet staged. Use `git diff --staged` for staged changes.
